Elements of the program DCIP2D
==============================

Introduction
------------

The **DCIP2D v5.0** program library consists of the programs:

#. **DCIPF2D**: performs forward modelling for DC and IP data

#. **DCINV2D**: inverts DC potentials to recover a conductivity model

#. **IPINV2D**: inverts IP data to recover a chargeability model

Each of the above programs requires input files as well as the
specification of parameters in order to run. However, some files are
used by a number of programs. Before detailing the run procedures for
each of the above programs we first present information about these
general files.

General files for Â programs
---------------------------

There are six general files which are used in **DCIP2D**. These are:

#. **observations file**: specifies the observed measurements and the associated electrode locations

#. **electrodes file**: contains the electrode locations for forward modelling

#. **mesh2D file**: contains the finite difference mesh for the 2D modelling and inversions. A special type of model file specifies the active cells.

#. **topo2D file**: contains the topographic data

#. **model2D file**: structure to hold cell values for models: conductivity, chargeability or active

#. **weights2D file**: file that contains special weightings which alter the type of model produced in the inversions
